Creating weather predictor using machine learning.
# Project Title
Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Project Description
This project predicts weather conditions (like sunny, rainy, cloudy) based on historical weather data using machine learning algorithms. The dataset is processed and used to train a model that gives weather predictions based on user input.

## 📂 Dataset Used
The dataset includes:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Precipitation
- Condition (Label)

It was stored in an Excel file and preprocessed using pandas.

## ⚙ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn openpyxl

2. Run the weather_predictor.py script
3. Input weather values to get predictions

## 🔍 Model Used
We used *Logistic Regression* for classification, achieving good accuracy on test data.
## ✅ Results
- Real-time predictions from user inputs

## 📈 Future Work
- Add support for more weather features
- Improve model accuracy using advanced algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Build a GUI for easy use
